# Functional Calculators

<a href="https://ghbmachado.github.io/functional-calculators/">Access the project here</a></p>

The project was developed looking for solutions to recurring problems, so here is a website that will help in solving these same mathematical problems.

## About the project

The idea for the site comes from a college assignment, where I would have to develop solutions for 10 problems in JavaScript, so I developed them through CSS, so that it contains stylizations in order to make the project visibly attractive. In this way, the objective is for it to be a simple, practical and functional website, with 10 types of properties and operations with a 100% assertive result.

## Technologies used
